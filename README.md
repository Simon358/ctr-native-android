# CTR Native

A native PC port of Crash Team Racing (PS1, 1999), built on top of the [CTR-ModSDK](https://github.com/CTR-tools/CTR-ModSDK) decompilation project.

## Philosophy

- **No byte budget.** Game source lives in `game/` as our own copies. Edit freely.
- **No PSX toolchain.** Targets Windows and Linux with SDL2 + PsyCross. No MIPS compiler needed.
- **Clean platform layer.** Game code calls through `platform.h`. SDL/PsyCross details stay in `ctr_native.c`.
- **No build system nonsense.** Just `build.bat` / `build.sh`.
- **Fully static build.** Single executable, zero dependencies. SDL2, OpenAL, and PsyCross are compiled from vendored source and linked statically.

## Directory Layout

```
ctr_native/
  ctr_native.c        Platform layer: SDL2 init, main(), frame loop
  ctr_native.h        Platform state structs
  platform.h          Platform API the game calls through
  game_includes.h     Ordered include chain for all game source files
  build.bat           Windows build (MinGW32)
  build.sh            Linux build
  README.md           This file
  game/               Our copies of all decompiled game source (943 files)
  include/            Project headers (structs, globals, declarations)
  externals/
    PsyCross/         PS1 hardware abstraction (GPU, GTE, SPU, CD)
    SDL/              SDL2 source (static build)
    openal-soft/      OpenAL source (static build)
```

## Prerequisites

### Windows

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. In an MSYS2 terminal:
   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-tools-git
   ```
3. Add `C:\msys64\mingw32\bin` to your system PATH

That's it. SDL2 and OpenAL are compiled from vendored source — no separate install needed.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```
sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxext-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

## Building

```
build.bat            # Windows
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh           # Linux
```

First build compiles SDL2, OpenAL, and PsyCross from source (~2-3 min). These are cached as static libraries in `build/` — subsequent builds only recompile `ctr_native.c`.

Output: `build/ctr_native.exe` (Windows) or `build/ctr_native` (Linux)

### Clean build

```
rm -rf build/        # Delete cached libraries
build.bat            # Rebuild everything
```

## Running

Place a CTR NTSC-U disc image (`ctr-u.bin`) next to the executable, then run it.

## Architecture

```
ctr_native.c (platform layer)
  |
  +-- PsyCross (PS1 hardware abstraction: GPU, GTE, SPU, CD)
  |     |
  |     +-- SDL2 (window, input, timing)
  |     +-- OpenAL (audio)
  |
  +-- game_includes.h
        |
        +-- game/ (all decompiled game source)
              |
              +-- include/ (headers: structs, globals, declarations)
```

- `REBUILD_PC` is defined, so all existing `#ifdef REBUILD_PC` guards activate
- `CTR_NATIVE` is also defined for our own platform-specific code
- The build uses 32-bit mode (`-m32`) and a fixed base address (`0x00500000`) because the game stores 24-bit pointers in data structures. This constraint will be removed in a future cleanup pass.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** (current): Get game booting via PsyCross + SDL2
2. **Phase 2**: Clean up `game/` copies — remove `#ifdef REBUILD_PC` guards, strip byte budget hacks, route everything through `platform.h`
3. **Phase 3**: Replace PsyCross with SDL3 + custom renderer. Remove 32-bit constraint. Own the full stack.
